# Summary

Congratulations, you have completed the Docker Search Command Challenge! In this challenge, you learned how to use the docker search command to search for images on the Docker Hub registry, filter search results, display more information about the search results, and show the max number of the search results. These skills will come in handy as you explore and use Docker images in your containerized applications.
