# Summary

In this challenge, you learned how to use Docker Multi-stage Build to create a smaller and more efficient Docker image. By using multiple stages in a Dockerfile, you can separate the build and runtime environments, and reduce the size of the final Docker image. With this knowledge, you can now start building your own Docker images using Multi-stage Build.
