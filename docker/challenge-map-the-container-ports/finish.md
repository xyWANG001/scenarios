# Summary

In this challenge, you learned how to use the `docker port` and the `docker run` command to manage ports in Docker step-by-step. You learned how to start a container, list the public-facing ports of a container, map a port to a specific IP address, map a port to a random port, and map multiple ports. With these skills, you can manage ports in Docker and make your applications accessible to the outside world.
