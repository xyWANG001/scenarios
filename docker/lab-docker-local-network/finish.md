# Summary

In this lab, we explored the three different types of Docker networking modes: Bridge, Host, and None. We learned that the mode we choose affects the level of isolation and communication between the Docker containers and the host machine. The Bridge mode isolates the container while allowing communication between containers on the same network. The Host mode allows the container to access the host resources directly while the None mode doesn't allow any communication between the containers and the host machine.
