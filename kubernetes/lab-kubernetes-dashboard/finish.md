# Summary

In this lab, we learned how to deploy and use Kubernetes Dashboard to manage and monitor a Kubernetes cluster. We deployed the dashboard, created a service account and cluster role binding to allow us to access it, and accessed the dashboard using a web browser. With Kubernetes Dashboard, you can easily deploy and manage applications, monitor cluster resources, and perform other administrative tasks.
