# Manage Kubernetes Deployment

## Introduction

In this challenge, you will learn how to scale and manage Pods with Deployments in Kubernetes. Deployments are a higher-level abstraction that allow you to declaratively manage and scale replica sets of Pods. By using Deployments, you can easily update your application to a new version, roll back to a previous version, and scale your application up or down to meet changing demand.
