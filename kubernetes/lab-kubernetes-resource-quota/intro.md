# Kubernetes ResourceQuota

## Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to use Kubernetes ResourceQuota to set limits on resource consumption in a Kubernetes cluster. ResourceQuota allows you to control and manage the allocation of resources such as CPU and memory for namespaces in a Kubernetes cluster. You will start with simple examples and gradually progress to more complex scenarios. Each step will provide code examples and instructions on how to apply them to your Kubernetes cluster.
