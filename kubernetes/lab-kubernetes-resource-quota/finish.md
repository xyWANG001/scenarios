# Summary

In this lab, you learned how to use Kubernetes ResourceQuota to set limits on resource consumption in a Kubernetes cluster. You started with creating a simple ResourceQuota, applying it to a namespace, and testing its enforcement by creating a pod that exceeds the resource limits. You also learned how to modify an existing ResourceQuota to update the resource limits. ResourceQuota is a powerful tool for managing resources in a Kubernetes cluster and ensuring that applications do not consume excessive resources.
