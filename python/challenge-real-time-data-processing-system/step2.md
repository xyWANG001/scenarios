# Data Processor

The purpose of this sub-challenge is to create a data processor that analyzes the stock market data generated by the data generator. The data processor should run in a separate process and continuously analyze the price updates to calculate average prices and detect trends.

## TODO

- Complete the `process_stock_data` function in `data_processor.py` to receive a tuple containing price and stock symbols from the queue.
- Implement a loop in the function that runs until a stop signal is received.
- In each iteration, retrieve the latest price updates from the data structure and calculate the average price for each stock.
- Detect trends in the price updates, such as a continuous increase or decrease in prices.
- Print the calculated average prices and detected trends.
- Use Python's `multiprocessing` module to run the data processor in a separate process.

## Help

When you are done with the `process_stock_data` function, you can test it using the `data_processor_test.py` file we have prepared for you, which has the following format for its output:

```zsh
$ python3 data_processor_test.py
# Output:
Average price of TSLA: 100.00
Average price of TSLA: 150.00
Average price of TSLA: 200.00
```
