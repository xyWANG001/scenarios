# Real-time Data Processing System

In this challenge, you will create a program to simulate a real-time stock market data processing system. This system will consist of two main components: a stock market data generator and a data processor. The data generator will continuously generate stock prices for multiple stocks, while the data processor will analyze the price changes and provide insights, such as average prices and price trends. Your task is to implement this system using Python's threading and multiprocessing capabilities to ensure efficient and concurrent execution.
