# File Extension Statistics

In this sub-challenge, you will create a file extension statistics generator that scans a specified directory and calculates the number of occurrences of each file extension. The generator should display a summary of the number of files with each extension in descending order of their count.

## TODO:

1. Complete the `generate_file_extension_statistics` function in `/home/labex/project/file_extension_statistics.py` and implement a file extension statistics generator using the `os` module.
2. Scan the specified directory for files and calculate the number of occurrences of each file extension.

## Example Usage

The path `test_example/file_extension_statistics_example` contains the following files:

- `1.txt`,
- `2.pdf`.

When you have finished the experiment, run the script to obtain the following results:

```python
python file_extension_statistics.py
```

Output:

```python
.txt: 1
.pdf: 1
```
